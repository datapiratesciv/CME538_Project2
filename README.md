### Background
This is project 2 for the course CME538. Our team name is Data Pirates. Our team members are Priyadarshani Dokhale, Shuping Wang, Siddharth Singaraju and Ray Coden Mercurius.

### Running the Code
This project is divided into 4 seperate subtasks. Each subtask has its own folder, prerequisite data files, and python notebook files for running. For a particular subdtask folder, all you need to do to get it running is download all of the python notebook and listed data files, and run them from the same working directory. 

Not all the data files were uploaded to Github due to file size constraints. Consult the README.md of each subtask for instructions on accessing these files via Google Drive.
